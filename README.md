# ViaForge
Clientside Implementation of ViaVersion for Forge

## For users

### Where can I download the latest version?
Just take a look at Curse-forge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/viaforge

### Can you add new textures and blocks from higher versions?
No, because it is too time-consuming

### ViaVersion throws an error, or I can't access a server, what should I do?
First of all see if it's because of an installed mod, otherwise come to my Discord and tell me logs, mc version etc.

### Certain collisions or other items bug, can you fix it?
No

## For developers

### How does it work?

### Project Structure

All ViaForge versions from Minecraft version 1.12 onwards are on the `master` branch. <br>
The names of the submodules indicate the version, they are always given in the format `mc-<version name without .>`. <br>
`Minecraft 1.12.2` - `mc1122`

### ViaForge for Minecraft 1.8

Since ForgeGradle for Minecraft 1.8 is too old, it has its own branch called `legacy-1.8`

### I want ViaForge in my own utility mod

Just take a look at our other Project called `ViaMCP`: https://github.com/RejectedVia/ViaMCP-Reborn
